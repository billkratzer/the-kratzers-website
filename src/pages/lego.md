I love Lego. While many of my hobbies are virtual in nature, Lego is my one big hobby that lets me work and play in the physical world.

# Town House
While I love working with physical bricks with my hands, I quite often do not have enough real bricks to build the types of projects that I would love to build. Enter the world of Lego 3D Modeling on the computer. The excellent Lego Studio application lets you build real Lego models in the virtual world! My first project was to build a model of our town house!
