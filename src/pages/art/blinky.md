# An Ode to Blinky

Growing up, I was fascinated by the arcade game, Pac-Man. I spent countless hours feeding quarters whenever 
I had the opportunity (and the quarters!).

One of my first forays into AI Art was using [Night Cafe's](https://nightcafe.studio) style transfer. 
The artwork below is the work of much experimentation with style-transfer using 
my [LEGO Blinky creation](/lego) as a source.
