## Colors

I wanted to get familiar with Javascript, so I thought it would be fun the program game using the Phaser game framework. This game is a re-write of a game that I wrote in college, back in 1991. I wrote this version of the game during a week-long vacation at the beach in North Carolina!

## Quartz Scheduler

Many years ago, I helped out on the Quartz Project. Quartz is a cool, open source project for Java-based job scheduling. I wrote examples and tutorials.
