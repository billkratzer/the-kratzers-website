Every decade, a computer technology takes the world by storm. The microprocessor, the Internet, social networking, and mobile apps have all dramatically changed the ways we live, work, and communicate.

AI and Machine Learning models and techniques have been around for decades. But over the last few years, we have seen AI techniques applied to image generation and text generation, with stunning results.

As someone who lacks the talent and skill to draw, paint, and color, the notion of using computer-assisted technology to paint and create artwork was very compelling to me. I have since played with Dall-E, Night Cafe, and Mid Journey. I have had a blast!
