Last week, I upgraded my home laptop.  Previously, I was running a 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro.  This was the first
generation of Apple's highly opinionated, super-thin and super-light laptops.   Input on the device was a disaster.
Apple lacked any real vision with the touch bar, and the keyboard was a well-documented disaster in terms of performance
and reliability. Despite its numerous shortcomings, the laptop dutifully served the family for seven years and is still
being used by my son today!

However, I really wanted to upgrade my home computing situation.  After using the M1 MacBook pros at work for the last year, 
I knew that it was time to upgrade to an M-series laptop at home, too.  

This time around, I chose the 15" MacBook Air - and I do not regret it!  I upgraded the laptop to 16GB of memory and 1TB of
storage.  The extra memory should cover any light programming that I do at home.  The extra of storage should provide plenty of
future proofing as my iCloud storage continues to grow year over year.

I could not be happier with this laptop.  The keyboard is great.  The screen looks fantastic.  The weight is a
welcome change from my work Macbook Pro (that thing is a beast!). The two USB ports are plenty - especially with
magsafe making a return to the new laptop line!  The speakers are also a welcome upgrade from prior MacBook airs - they 
sound great.

I opted for a Midnight case.  It looks awesome, in all lighting situations.  I really wish the MacBook Pros sported this color.

I only hae two minor issues with the laptop:

+ All ports are on the left side of the device
+ The Midnight case shows fingerprints 

These are really minor nitpicks with an otherwise nearly perfect laptop!
