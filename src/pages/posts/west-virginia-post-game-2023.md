The West Virginia game pretty much went to script.   WVU loaded the box and challenged
Drew Allar to throw the ball.  And throw the ball he did!   Nicholas Singleton and Kaytron
Allen were able to get some momentum on the ground.  Defensively, Penn State held West Virginia
to seven points with an additional touchdown late in the four quarter when Penn State's backups
were in the game.

Quick thoughts:

1.  Drew Allar looked great.  He made some tough throws and generally made good decisions.
2.  Allar wasn't perfect however - most notably that near-pick in the end-zone at the end of the first half!
3.  KLS was definitely receiver #1, but we have no answers for receivers #2 and #3, but the ball was spread around to 9 different receivers.
4.  But none of those receivers were the tight-ends, who seemed limited to blocking roles.
4.  The kicking game was definitely shaky.
5.  The defensive line definitely had some problems with WVU's offensive line.
6.  The entire defense seemed about a half-step behind in the first half, allowing WVU and their mobile quarterbafck to sustain some drives.
7.  The pass coverage was pretty good!

All in all, a great start for the Nittany Lions.  Onward to Delaware!

*Go STATE!*
