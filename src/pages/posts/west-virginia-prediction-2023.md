## Prediction:  Penn State 31, West Virginia 10

The Nittany Lions start the 2023 football season at home, in a near white out.
All eyes will be on sophomore quarterback Drew Allar as he makes his debut as the 
leader of the Penn State 2023 offense.

Expect the West Virginia game plan to include loading up the box and daring Drew Allar
to make a throw.  Drew should be supported a talented and deep offensive line, the best 
running back duo in the country, and possibly the best tighten room in the country.
Beyond Keandre Lambert Smith, there are questions on who will emerge as receivers number
two and three, but there is plenty of young talent (and experienced transfers) waiting
to emerge.

Defensively, Penn State should have little problems stopping the West Virginia offense.
The biggest challenge will be the Penn State defensive line against the West Virginia
stout offensive line.

If West Virginia can contain the Nittany Lion running game and force Drew Allar into some
bad decisions, then we could have a tight ball game heading into the fourth quarter.
However, I think the Nittany Lions will get the ground game going and the receivers will
get open quick enough to show the College Football world what Drew Allar is all about.

*Go STATE!*
