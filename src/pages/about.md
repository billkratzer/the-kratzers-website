# About Me

I started playing with computers when I was 10-years old, when I got an [Atari 400](http://oldcomputers.net/atari400.html)
for Christmas.   I learned how to program in [Atari BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_BASIC),
and quickly learned [6502 Assembly](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/6502_Assembly)
so that I could squeeze every last bit of power out of that tiny 1.44 Mhz [6502 MOS processor](http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/650x/index.html).

In high school and college, my computer programming hobby shifted to the world of PCs.  I learned object oriented
[Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal),
[Turbo C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B), and 
[80x86 assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language)
I also delved into high-performance graphics programming using so that I could squeeze ever last bit of [power](https://web.archive.org/web/20070123192523/http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article356.asp) 
out of a slightly more powerful 16 Mhz processor and VGA card!

During college, I fell in love with UNIX, the Internet, and [Linux](https://linux.org).

After college, my programming world has revolved around Java, Kotlin, and JavaScript.
From time to time, I have played with other programming languages such as [Go](https://golang.org) and [Lua](https://www.lua.org).

Today, I spend most of my day on my Mac, on servers, and on the web.
